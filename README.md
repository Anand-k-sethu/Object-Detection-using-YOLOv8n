# Object Detection Model Training and Dataset Preparation

## Project Description
This project involves preparing the **PASCAL VOC dataset** for training an object detection model using the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** architecture. The model identifies and classifies various objects in images, including common items like **cars**, **animals**, and **people**. The goal is to build a system that can automatically detect and classify these objects in real-time, making it valuable for applications like surveillance, autonomous driving, and more.

## Relevance of the Project
Object detection has a wide range of real-world applications, from self-driving cars to security cameras. This project automates the detection of various object classes, helping industries in need of **real-time object identification**. The dataset is processed and prepared to train the model efficiently, leading to faster detection and classification, which can **improve system accuracy** and **reduce human intervention**.

## Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Converts the PASCAL VOC dataset annotations to YOLO format for training.
- **Dataset Subsetting**: Selects random subsets for training and validation to ensure model robustness.
- **Model Training**: Trains the YOLOv8 model to detect 20 object classes, including **animals**, **vehicles**, and **people**.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Measures metrics like **precision**, **recall**, and **mAP** to gauge model accuracy.

## Steps Involved:

1. **Converting PASCAL VOC Annotations to YOLO Format**:
   - The project processes **XML annotation files** from the PASCAL VOC dataset, extracting object bounding boxes and class labels.
   - The annotations are converted to **YOLO format**, which is a more efficient format for training object detection models.

2. **Preparing Subsets for Training and Validation**:
   - Random subsets of images and labels are selected for training and validation, ensuring balanced and diverse data.
   - These subsets are organized into appropriate directories for use in the model training.

3. **Training the YOLOv8 Model**:
   - The YOLOv8 model is trained on the prepared dataset using **GPU resources**, which allows for fast and accurate object detection.
   - Hyperparameters like **image size** and **batch size** are tuned for optimal performance.

4. **Evaluating Model Performance**:
   - The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like **Precision**, **Recall**, and **mAP** (Mean Average Precision) to measure its accuracy in detecting objects.

## Skills Used:
- **Python**: Utilized for data processing and training the model.
- **Machine Learning**: Applied to train and fine-tune the object detection model.
- **Deep Learning**: Leveraged deep learning techniques for image classification and object detection with YOLO.
- **Data Processing**: Preprocessed and prepared the PASCAL VOC dataset for training.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using various evaluation metrics (precision, recall, mAP).

## Results:
The model achieved the following performance metrics:
- **Precision**: 0.77
- **Recall**: 0.55
- **mAP (Mean Average Precision) at 50% IoU**: 0.63
- **mAP at 50-95% IoU**: 0.45

These results demonstrate the model's potential to detect objects with high precision and efficiency, with room for further improvement through additional training and fine-tuning.
